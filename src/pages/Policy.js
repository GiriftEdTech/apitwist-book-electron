                    <p>
                        By submitting your email address on this website/app, you agree to receive emails from us. You

                    <h3>How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h3>
                    <p>
                        We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide ApiTwist to you and fulfill the
                        purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your
                        information with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your
                        information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory
                        obligations, we’ll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't
                        identify you.

                    <h3>How Do We Protect Your Information?</h3>
                    <p>
                        We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information

                        of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket
                        Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be
                        accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to
                        keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information (credit cards,
                        social security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file. We cannot, however, ensure or
                        warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to ApiTwist or guarantee that your

                    <h3>Could my information be transferred to other countries?</h3>
                    <p>
                        ApiTwist is incorporated in Turkey. Information collected via our website/app, through direct
                        interactions with you, or from use of our help services may be transferred from time to time to
                        our offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and may be viewed
                        and hosted anywhere in the world, including countries that may not have laws of general
                        applicability regulating the use and transfer of such data. To the fullest extent allowed by
                        applicable law, by using any of the above, you voluntarily consent to the trans-border transfer
                        and hosting of such information.

                    <h3>Is the information collected through the ApiTwist Service secure?</h3>
                    <p>
                        We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic,
                        and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data
                        security, and correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems are
                        foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make
                        mistakes or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your
                        personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes any
                        non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal information, you agree that intentional
                        misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.

                        depend on your relationship with ApiTwist. Personnel may update or correct their information as
                        detailed in our internal company employment policies. Customers have the right to request the
                        restriction of certain uses and disclosures of personally identifiable information as follows.
                        You can contact us in order to (1) update or correct your personally identifiable information,
                        (2) change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive
                        from us, or (3) delete the personally identifiable information maintained about you on our
                        systems (subject to the following paragraph), by cancelling your account. Such updates,
                        corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on other information that we maintain, or
                        information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior
                        to such update, correction, change or deletion. To protect your privacy and security, we may
                        take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before
                        granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the
                        secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times. You should be aware that
                        it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have
                        provided to us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect information from
                        inadvertent loss means that a copy of your information may exist in a non-erasable form that
                        will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Promptly after receiving your request, all
                        personal information stored in databases we actively use, and other readily searchable media
                        will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent
                        reasonably and technically practicable. If you are an end user and wish to update, delete, or
                        receive any information we have about you, you may do so by contacting the organization of which
                        you are a customer.

                        websites not operated or controlled by ApiTwist. We are not responsible for the content,

                        monitored or checked for accuracy or completeness by us. Please remember that when you use a

                        browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our platform,
                        is subject to that website’s own rules and policies. Such third parties may use their own

                    <h3>Advertising</h3>
                    <p>
                        This website/app may contain third party advertisements and links to third party sites. ApiTwist
                        does not make any representation as to the accuracy or suitability of any of the information
                        contained in those advertisements or sites and does not accept any responsibility or liability
                        for the conduct or content of those advertisements and sites and the offerings made by the third
                        parties. Advertising keeps ApiTwist and many of the websites and services you use free of
                        charge. We work hard to make sure that ads are safe, unobtrusive, and as relevant as possible.
                        Third party advertisements and links to other sites where goods or services are advertised are
                        not endorsements or recommendations by ApiTwist of the third party sites, goods or services.
                        ApiTwist takes no responsibility for the content of any of the ads, promises made, or the
                        quality/reliability of the products or services offered in all advertisements.

                    <h3>Cookies for Advertising</h3>
                    <p>
                        These cookies collect information over time about your online activity on the website/app and
                        other online services to make online advertisements more relevant and effective to you. This is
                        known as interest-based advertising. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad
                        from continuously reappearing and ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers.
                        Without cookies, it’s really hard for an advertiser to reach its audience, or to know how many
                        ads were shown and how many clicks they received.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Cookies</h3>

                        also be aware that you may also lose some saved information (e.g. saved login details, site
                        preferences) if you block cookies on your browser. Different browsers make different controls
                        available to you. Disabling a cookie or category of cookie does not delete the cookie from your
                        browser, you will need to do this yourself from within your browser, you should visit your
                        browser's help menu for more information.

                        EU residents. Our customers’ data is important irrespective of where they are located, which is
                        why we have implemented GDPR controls as our baseline standard for all our operations worldwide.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What is personal data?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum
                        of information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of
                        information, to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person’s name or email
                        address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic data,
                        biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity. The Data
                        Protection Principles include requirements such as:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should
                            only be used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be
                            used for that purpose. Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they
                            collect it.
                        </li>
                        <li>Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.</li>
                        <li>
                            People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also
                            request a copy of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved
                            to another organization.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Why is GDPR important?</h3>
                    <p>
                        GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals' personal
                        data that they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing
                        enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts it's simply the right
                        thing to do. At ApiTwist we strongly believe that your data privacy is very important and we
                        already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go beyond the requirements of
                        this new regulation.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Individual Data Subject's Rights - Data Access, Portability and Deletion</h3>
                    <p>
                        We are committed to helping our customers meet the data subject rights requirements of GDPR.
                        ApiTwist processes or stores all personal data in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors. We do
                        store all conversation and personal data for up to 6 years unless your account is deleted. In
                        which case, we dispose of all data in accordance with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy,
                        but we will not hold it longer than 60 days. We are aware that if you are working with EU
                        customers, you need to be able to provide them with the ability to access, update, retrieve and
                        remove personal data. We got you! We've been set up as self service from the start and have
                        always given you access to your data and your customers data. Our customer support team is here
                        for you to answer any questions you might have about working with the API.

                    <h3>No Warranties</h3>

                        The website/app is provided to you "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects
                        without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, ApiTwist, on
                        its own behalf and on behalf of its affiliates and its and their respective licensors and
                        service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or

                        that the website/app will meet your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or

                        meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can
                        or will be corrected. Without limiting the foregoing, neither ApiTwist nor any ApiTwist's
                        provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the
                        operation or availability of the website/app, or the information, content, and materials or
                        products included thereon; (ii) that the website/app will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii)
                        as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content provided through the

                        other harmful components. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of or limitations on
                        implied warranties or the limitations on the applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some
                        or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to you.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
                    <p>
                        Notwithstanding any damages that you might incur, the entire liability of ApiTwist and any of
                        its suppliers under any provision of this Agreement and your exclusive remedy for all of the
                        foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by you for the website/app. To the
                        maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall ApiTwist or its suppliers be
                        liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including,
                        but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, for loss of data or other information, for
                        business interruption, for personal injury, for loss of privacy arising out of or in any way
                        related to the use of or inability to use the website/app, third-party software and/or
                        third-party hardware used with the website/app, or otherwise in connection with any provision of
                        this Agreement), even if ApiTwist or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such
                        damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose. Some states/jurisdictions do not
                        allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above
                        limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Severability</h3>
                    <p>
                        If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will
                        be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent
                        possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and
                        effect. This Agreement, together with the Privacy Policy and any other legal notices published
                        by ApiTwist on the Services, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and ApiTwist
                        concerning the Services. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of
                        competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the
                        remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver
                        of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any
                        other term, and ApiTwist’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall
                        not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. YOU AND ApiTwist AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF
                        ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE
                        CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Waiver</h3>
                    <p>
                        Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an
                        obligation under this Agreement shall not effect a party's ability to exercise such right or
                        require such performance at any time thereafter nor shall be the waiver of a breach constitute
                        waiver of any subsequent breach. No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part
                        of either party, any right or any power under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of that
                        right or power. Nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or power under this
                        Agreement preclude further exercise of that or any other right granted herein. In the event of a
                        conflict between this Agreement and any applicable purchase or other terms, the terms of this
                        Agreement shall govern.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Amendments to this Agreement</h3>
                    <p>
                        ApiTwist reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace this Agreement at any
                        time. If a revision is material we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms
                        taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. By
                        continuing to access or use our website/app after any revisions become effective, you agree to
                        be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer
                        authorized to use ApiTwist.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and ApiTwist regarding your use of
                        the website/app and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous written or oral agreements between
                        you and ApiTwist. You may be subject to additional terms and conditions that apply when you use
                        or purchase other ApiTwist's services, which ApiTwist will provide to you at the time of such
                        use or purchase.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Updates to Our Terms</h3>
                    <p>
                        We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that
                        they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will

                        INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. The term “dispute” means any dispute, action, or other controversy
                        between you and ApiTwist concerning the Services or this agreement, whether in contract,
                        warranty, tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis. “Dispute”

                    </p>
                    <h3>Notice of Dispute</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the event of a dispute, you or ApiTwist must give the other a Notice of Dispute, which is a
                        written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving
                        it, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested. You must send any Notice of
                        Dispute via email to: support@girift.tech. ApiTwist will send any Notice of Dispute to you by
                        mail to your address if we have it, or otherwise to your email address. You and ApiTwist will
                        attempt to resolve any dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date
                        the Notice of Dispute is sent. After sixty (60) days, you or ApiTwist may commence arbitration.

                    <h3>Binding Arbitration</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you and ApiTwist don’t resolve any dispute by informal negotiation, any other effort to
                        resolve the dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration as described in this
                        section. You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member)
                        all disputes in court before a judge or jury. The dispute shall be settled by binding
                        arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration
                        Association. Either party may seek any interim or preliminary injunctive relief from any court
                        of competent jurisdiction, as necessary to protect the party’s rights or property pending the
                        completion of arbitration. Any and all legal, accounting, and other costs, fees, and expenses
                        incurred by the prevailing party shall be borne by the non-prevailing party.

                        canceled, we shall immediately issue a credit to your credit card account or other payment
                        account in the amount of the charge.

                        If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision or portion of these
                        Terms & Conditions to be unenforceable, the remainder of these Terms & Conditions will continue
                        in full force and effect. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms & Conditions will be
                        effective only if in writing and signed by an authorized representative of ApiTwist. ApiTwist
                        will be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief (without the obligations of posting any

                        distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation. Accordingly, those persons who
                        choose to access the ApiTwist Service from other locations do so on their own initiative and are
                        solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are
                        applicable. These Terms & Conditions (which include and incorporate the ApiTwist Privacy Policy)

                        ApiTwist concerning its subject matter, and cannot be changed or modified by you. The section
                        headings used in this Agreement are for convenience only and will not be given any legal import.

                    <h3>Advertising Cookies</h3>
                    <p>
                        These cookies collect information over time about your online activity on the website/app and
                        other online services to make online advertisements more relevant and effective to you. This is
                        known as interest-based advertising. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad
                        from continuously reappearing and ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers.
                        Without cookies, it’s really hard for an advertiser to reach its audience, or to know how many
                        ads were shown and how many clicks they received.

                        audiences for future ads, and remarket to qualified users who have already taken certain action

                    <p>
                        Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their 'settings' preferences. However, if you
                        limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since
                        it will no longer be personalized to you. It may also stop you from saving customized settings
                        like login information. Browser manufacturers provide help pages relating to cookie management

                        ApiTwist has affiliate links and in this section of the Disclaimer we will address how we use
                        those affiliate links from other websites/companies and products. These “affiliate links” are
                        specific URLs that contain the affiliate's ID or username. page 3/5 In compliance with the FTC

                                Any/all of the links on ApiTwist are affiliate links of which we receive a small
                                commission from sales of certain items, but the price is the same for you. As ApiTwist
                                has grown, so have costs associated with running and maintaining it, and affiliate links
                                are a way we help offset these costs.

                                support and would recommend without an affiliate link.

                    <h3>Financial Disclosure</h3>
                    <p>
                        Gross merchandise sales is a non-GAAP metric. We use it to express the total demand across all
                        of our web sites and stores. This number measures the dollar value of the order placed in the
                        year before accruing for certain items such as returns, and it ignores certain timing cut-offs
                        that are required by GAAP for revenue recognition purposes. If we were a public company, we
                        would have to reconcile gross merchandise sales to the nearest GAAP metric (net sales), but we
                        are currently a private company so the gross merchandise sales number should be viewed just as
                        an interesting number that we want to share with our friends. This document contains
                        forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if
                        they ever materialise or prove incorrect, could cause or results to differ materially from those
                        expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements and assumptions. These risks and
                        uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risk of economic slowdown, the risk of over
                        or underbuying, the risk of consumers not shopping online at our website/app at the rate we
                        expected, the risk of supplier shortages, the risk of new or growing competition, the risk of
                        natural or some other type of disaster affecting our fulfilment of historical operations or web
                        servers, and the risk of the world generally coming to an end. All statements other than
                        statements historical fact are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements,
                        including statements of expectation or belief; and any statement of assumptions underlying any
                        of the foregoing. ApiTwist assumes no obligation and does not intend to update these
                        forward-looking statements.
